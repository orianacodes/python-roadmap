This repository documents my commitment to mastering Python through consistent, daily practice.

As a Computer Science senior, I am focused on building a strong foundation in Python and other programming languages to prepare for future roles in software development, data analysis, or related fields in technology.

Each folder contains a daily lesson and practice exercise, covering both fundamental and advanced concepts, with the goal of applying them in d professional environments.
