## Day 5: Functions and Modules

## Functions
- A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task only when you call it. It is a program inside your code that you can reuse.
- With functions your code will be able to stay organized
- Parameters (arguments): are pieces of data you pass into the function
- return value is what comes back when you use the function.  

## Example 
```python
def greet(name): # 'def' defines the function, greet is the function name
   return "Hello, " + name  #gives output when you call it

## Modules

- A module is a Python file (.py) that contains functions, variables, or classes.
- It is a toolbox of code that you can import into another Python Script
