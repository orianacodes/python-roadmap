## Functions with Return Values and Parameters
In Python, a **function** is a block of code that only runs when it's called.

## Parameters vs Arguments
- **Parameters** are variables listed in the function definition.
- **Arguments** are values passed to the function when it is called.

## Return Values
- The `return` statement ends a function and sends a value back to where the function was called.
- This is different from `print()`, which only outputs to the screen.

## Definitions
- **Function:** A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Parameter:** A variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. Think of it like a label or a placeholder.
- **Argument:** The actual value you pass to the function when calling it.
- **Return:** A statement that sends a result back from the function to wherever it was called.

### Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name

message = greet("Ori")
print(message)  # Output: Hello Ori
