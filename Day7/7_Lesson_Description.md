## Day 7:Default Parameters, Return, print and Docstrings
- **Functions** can have default parameter values
- **return** and **print()** are different
- **Docstrings** help document your code 

  ## Definitions

  - **Parameter** a variable in the function definition. It acts as a placeholder for the value (argument) passed to the function when called.
  - **Argument** the actual value passed to a function when it is called.
  - **Default Parameter** a parameter that has a default value if no argument is provided during the function call.
  - **Return Statement** used to send back a value from a function to where it was called. The function ends when return is executed.
  - **Print Statement** Displays output to the console, but doesn't return anything to the program. The function continues after print() unless explicitly stopped.
 
- **Docstring** A string used to describe what a function (or module/class) does. It is placed immediately after the function definition and it enclosed in triple quotes (""").
